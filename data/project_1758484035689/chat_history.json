Rich Communication Services (RCS) is now generally available, bringing trusted, rich conversations that bring precise engagement to your customer communication toolkit. The messaging industry has been buzzing for the past year about the arrival of RCS and what it means for interacting with consumers. In a world where every business is vying for consumer attention and trust matters more than ever, RCS business messaging will change business communications as we know it.\n\nCan a messaging channel really make that big of an impact? The short answer is\u2026 yes. RCS introduces revolutionary functionality to A2P texting for both brands and consumers. Consumers get to experience a new way of texting a brand. Instead of 160 characters of text and an unknown number, they can interact with a verified and branded sender filled with rich functionality that builds trust directly into every interaction. 88% of consumers who received a message with a verification badge reported increased trust. On the business side, brands are able to increase their engagement through a channel that brings their branding directly to a customer\u2019s lock screen, builds customer loyalty, and drives action.\n\nCustomers\u2019 increased engagement comes from an additional layer of verification and branding, and rich interactions like quick reply buttons, clickable image carousels, and more that just aren\u2019t possible with SMS. Nova Gest\u00f5es, a credit recovery org based in Brazil, gravitated toward RCS to help customers connect quickly through a trusted texting experience and saw instant results.\n\n\n\"RCS through Twilio has transformed how we engage with our customers. With RCS, we\u2019ve seen a 4x improvement in response rates compared to SMS.\"\n\n- Juliano Skrzyszowski, Nova Gest\u00f5es, CTO\n\nIf you want to dive into what RCS can do, here are 6 things to know about RCS. However, if you have already decided to jump on the RCS bandwagon, read on to learn about how we\u2019ve invested in our platform to seamlessly integrate RCS into your current messaging solution.\n\nBuilt for builders: Integrate with zero code changes and no new API\nAnother channel doesn\u2019t have to mean more work. We\u2019ve prioritized the builder experience so you can adopt RCS without introducing technical debt. From onboarding to managing rich content and monitoring your entire messaging solution at scale, Twilio has tailored this experience to make builders\u2019 lives easier, and here is how:\n\nUpgrade with zero code changes: If you\u2019re already using Twilio\u2019s Programmable Messaging API, you can enable RCS on your existing Messaging Services\u2014no new APIs or SDKs required. Manage SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, and RCS through a single endpoint architecture. This also means no new developers are needed, no never-ending engineering sprints, and no new code to maintain.\nBuild rich content once and deploy across all messaging channels: Typically, engineers need to build individual messaging workflows to manage their rich content across channels since each channel has different capabilities and protocols. To simplify message functionality across channels, our Content Template Builder supports both API and UI workflows. You can build rich content for RCS once\u2014images, videos, quick replies, carousels\u2014and deploy it across channels while also implementing automatic fall back to SMS/MMS or WhatsApp to ensure that your message is always delivered. RCS is a growing channel and is available in 22 countries as of August 2025. This means that implementing SMS/MMS or WhatsApp fallback is essential to message deliverability as RCS continues to expand.\nMonitor and troubleshoot with traffic insights, data, and AI: Our Messaging Insights provides out-of-the-box dashboards across channels, so you can compare performance for SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, and RCS in one place. RCS adds critical engagement metrics, including read receipts and clicks available through webhooks, fueling A/B testing and optimization. You can tie messaging campaigns directly to engagement, loyalty, and revenue outcomes, and give your leadership the visibility they need to scale investment with confidence.",
