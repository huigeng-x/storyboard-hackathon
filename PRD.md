# AI Storyboard Generator - Product Overview

## Product Vision

An intelligent storyboard creation platform that transforms user-provided documents, images, and requirements into professional, ready-to-use storyboards through AI-powered automation and interactive refinement.

## Target Users

- **Marketing Teams**: Creating campaign storyboards and promotional content
- **Content Creators**: Developing video scripts and visual narratives
- **Product Managers**: Visualizing user journeys and feature demonstrations
- **Creative Agencies**: Rapid prototyping for client presentations
- **Customer Education/L&D**: Building instructional and educational content

## Core Value Proposition

Instead of manually creating storyboards from scratch, users can upload their source materials (documents, brand guidelines, reference images) and receive AI-generated storyboard sequences that capture their vision. The platform combines automated content analysis with interactive refinement to produce professional-quality results in minutes rather than hours.

## Primary Use Cases

### Campaign Development
Marketing teams upload campaign briefs, brand assets, and target audience information. The system generates storyboard sequences for advertisements, social media content, or promotional videos that align with brand guidelines and messaging objectives.

### Product Demo
Product teams provide feature documentation and UI screenshots. The platform creates step-by-step storyboards showing user interactions, workflows, and key product benefits for training materials or sales presentations.

### Market/Customer Education
Turn dense product docs, support tickets, and webinar decks into clear, on-brand storyboards that educate prospects, customers, and partnersâ€”without turning your CSMs into part-time instructional designers or content marketers.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Initial Context Gathering

Users provide foundational project information through multiple input methods:

- **Document Upload**: Project briefs, scripts, brand guidelines, technical specifications
- **Image Upload**: Reference photos, mood boards, existing brand assets, style guides
- **Form Input**: Project type, target audience, duration requirements, style preferences
- **Template Selection**: Pre-configured starting points for common storyboard types

The system processes these inputs to understand project scope, visual direction, messaging priorities, and technical constraints.

### 2. Interactive Requirements Refinement

An intelligent chatbot conducts natural language conversations to gather missing or unclear information:

- **Audience Clarification**: "Who is the primary audience for this storyboard?"
- **Call to Action**: "What do you want your users to be able to do after this video?"
- **Technical Specifications**: "Intended output format and duration"

The chatbot adapts its questions based on the information already provided and the specific project type.

### 3. AI-Powered Storyboard Generation

The system analyzes all gathered requirements and generates comprehensive storyboard sequences:

- **Scene Structure**: Logical sequence of screens that tell the complete story
- **Screen Type**: Choose one from the five types: stock video, screencast, talking head, CTA, Slides/Text overlay
- **Visual Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions of what appears in each panel
- **Image Suggestions**: Recommended visuals sourced from uploaded assets or visual descriptions
- **Narrative Elements**: Text overlays, dialogue, voiceover scripts, and captions
- **Timing Information**: Duration for each panel and transition recommendations (word count/130 * 60 s)
- **Action Notes for Different Types of Screens**:
  - `[Stock video type]` default NULL
  - `[Screencast]`: `[{type:"click|type|select|scroll|zoom", ui_path:"Menu > Submenu", target?:"selector", value?, expected_output?}]`
  - `[Talking head]`: tight/mid/wide
  - `[Slides/Text overlay]`: default NULL
  - `[CTA]`: default NULL

Each generated storyboard maintains consistency with brand guidelines and project requirements while following best practices for visual storytelling.

### 4. Direct Storyboard Editing

Users can manually refine the generated storyboard through intuitive editing interfaces:

**Text Editing**
- **Panel Titles**: Modify scene names and descriptions
- **Narrative Content**: Edit voiceover scripts, dialogue, and text overlays
- **Technical Notes**: Adjust timing, transition types, and production instructions
- **Metadata**: Update panel tags, categories, and reference information

### 5. Conversational Feedback and Iteration

Users can provide natural language feedback about specific panels or the overall storyboard:

- **Panel-Specific Comments**: "Make panel 3 more dramatic" or "The text in panel 5 is too long"
- **Style Adjustments**: "Use warmer colors throughout" or "Make the tone more professional"
- **Content Modifications**: "Add a call-to-action in the final panel" or "Emphasize the environmental benefits"
- **Technical Changes**: "Extend the duration of the opening sequence" or "Reduce the total panel count"

The chatbot understands context-specific feedback and can make targeted adjustments while maintaining overall storyboard coherence.

## User Journey

**Step 1: Project Initiation**  
User uploads source materials and provides initial project context through forms or direct input.

**Step 2: Context Gathering**  
AI agent parses the content and searches for additional context before returning to users to ask for further clarification questions.

**Step 3: Requirements Gathering**  
An interactive chatbot asks clarifying questions to fill information gaps and refine requirements.

**Step 4: AI Generation**  
System processes all inputs and generates a complete storyboard with multiple panels, descriptions, and technical specifications. Source related images online for image placeholders from the image description texts suggested by AI.

**Step 5: Review and Edit**  
User reviews the generated storyboard and makes direct edits to text, structure, or panel order as needed.

**Step 6: Conversational Refinement**  
User provides natural language feedback through the chatbot for specific improvements or overall adjustments.

**Step 7: Finalization**  
The system incorporates all feedback and produces the final storyboard ready for production use.
